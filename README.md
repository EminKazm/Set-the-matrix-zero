# The-matrix
# Algorithm such that if an element in an MxN matrix is 0, its entire row and column is set to 0
I have  created ans(answer) array mxn and initialize each elements as 1.In line 19-28 the program traverse the matrix row major and if the current row contains zero then program set rows as 0 in answer array.Then in line 31-39 the program traverse the matrix column major,and if the current column contains zero then program set columns as 0 in answer array.Then program traverse answer and if the current elemets equals to zero then program set this element to as 0 in matrix array
